# analyse-packets-with-wireshark
This project opens a packet capture (pcap) file and explores the basic Wireshark Graphical User Interface. It opens a detailed view of a single packet and explores how to examine the various protocol and data layers inside a network packet. It applies filters to TCP packet data to search for specific payload text data.
